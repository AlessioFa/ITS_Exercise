# Exercise 1-1

# Initialize a floating-point number to x
x: float = 2.5

# Calculate the reciprocal of x and assign it to y
y: float = 1.0 / x

# Display the value of x
print(f"This is the value of x :{x}")

# Display the value of y
print(f"This is the value of y :{y}")

# Calculate and display the product of x and y
print(f"This is the product of x and y :{x * y}")

# Calculate and display the difference between x and the product x * y
print(f"Difference between x and the product of x and y: {x - (x*y)}")
