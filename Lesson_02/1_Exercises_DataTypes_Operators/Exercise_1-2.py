# Exercise 1-2

# Initialize a floating-point number to x
x: float = 5.5

# Calculate x % 2.0 and assign the result to y
y: float = x % 2.0

# Display the value of x
print(f"This is the value of x (positive): {x}")

# Display the value of y
print(f"This is the value of y (positive): {y}")

# Now i assign a negative value to x and y and calculate x % -2.0

x: float = 5.5

y: float = x % -2.0

print(f"This is the value of x: {x}")

print(f"This is the value of y: {y}")

# When the dividend and divisor are negative, or the divisor is negative
# the modulo result will have a negative sign.
