## ITS_Exercises

This repository contains Python programming exercises completed during my cybersecurity studies.  
The exercises focus on fundamental topics such as:

- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Control flow (if, for, while)
- Functions and advanced parameters (*args, **kwargs)

I plan to expand the repository with more advanced topics in the future, including:
- File handling (reading/writing files)
- Security basics and cryptography
- Python automation

## Repository Structure

The exercises are organized using a numerical format for better ordering. Examples:
5-8_Hello_Admin.py
5-9_No_Users.py

## How to Use This Repository

To run the exercises:  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlessioFa/ITS_Exercises.git
2. Open a file in an editor like VS Code or PyCharm.
3. Run the script using:
   python filename.py```

## Code Style

This repository follows Python best practices using Flake8, a tool for enforcing PEP 8 style guidelines.
To check for style issues, first install Flake8 (if not already installed):
pip install flake8
Then, run the following command in the repository's root directory:
flake8 .

ðŸ”’ Security Focus

As I progress in my course, I will add more advanced exercises related to cybersecurity.
