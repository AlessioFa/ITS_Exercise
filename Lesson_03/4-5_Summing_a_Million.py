# Exercise 4-5: Summing a million

# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 1 million
million: int = list(range(1, 1000001))

# Find the minimum value in the list
min_million = min(million)
print(min_million)

# Find the maximum value in the list
max_million = max(million)
print(max_million)

# Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list
sum_million = sum(million)
print(sum_million)
